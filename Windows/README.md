Provided here is a batch script you can use to set up L2Tunnel for use with XLink Kai. Like the Linux counterpart, its all been crammed into one script. However this does rely on `curl` and `tar`. I do not know when these were added into Windows but this assumes you're using the latest version of Windows 10.

You will need to install [npcap](https://nmap.org/npcap/dist/npcap-1.10.exe) before doing anything else however.
